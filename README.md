# ADA Project

This project is about finding the minimum edit distance between two DNA sequences using different approaches.

## Files

- `analysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the scalability analysis of different approaches.
- `divide_n_conquer.py` and `divide_n_conquer_dp.py`: These files implement the divide and conquer approach.
- `dynamic_program.py` and `dynamic_program_memo.py`: These files implement the dynamic programming approach.
- `min_edits.py`: This file contains the function for calculating the minimum edit distance.
- `recursive.py`: This file implements the recursive approach.
- `tests.py`: This file contains the unit tests for all the approaches.

## How to Run

1. Run the tests using the command: `python tests.py`
2. Open the `analysis.ipynb` notebook to see the scalability analysis.
